{"name":"Librebecca","tagline":"RebeccaAIML Artificial Intelligence Engine","body":"------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* WELCOME!\r\n\r\nThis is the RebeccaAIML Project.  \r\n\r\nRebeccaAIML is an enterprise cross platform open source \r\nAIML development platform. RebeccaAIML supports C++, Java,\r\nC#, and Python as well as many other programming languages\r\nand AIML development out of the box.  RebeccaAIML also \r\ncomes with an array of AIML administration tools, great \r\ndocumentation, and an eclipse AIML editor plugin. \r\n\r\n{ From the redistributor: \r\n\r\n## NOTE: This distrobution is not the official RebeccaAIML\r\nproject, but a re-distrobution for GNU/Linux users, because \r\nthe authors source code was written in Visual Studio and didn't\r\nplay well with modern Linux machines. This source has been\r\nsuccessfully tested on Ubuntu and Gentoo machines, with only\r\nstandard Ubuntu .debs and standard Gentoo .ebuilds.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, This is not the authors release, the last release from\r\nthe original author was in 2007.\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* AUTHOR and LICENSE\r\n\r\nFrank Hassanabad : foreverlinux@yahoo.com\r\nDrop me an email if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nSee 'copyright' about the GPLv3 licence in which \r\nthis project is covered.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* PROGRAMMING WITH THE API AND FRAMEWORK\r\n\r\nSo how do you start programming with the API and/or framework?  \r\nFor a quick start check out the source code of the samples.  \r\nyou'll find them under [src\\samples]. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE APIs AND FRAMEWORK\r\n\r\nWhere's the full documentation of the APIs and FRAMEWORK at?  You can \r\nfind the documentation of the api and framework in the [doc] directory.\r\nunder Linux that's  [/usr/share/librebecca/doc]\r\n\r\nYou can also find more documentation at the RebeccaAIML website: \r\nhttp://rebecca-aiml.sourceforge.net/documentation.htm\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* COMPILING THE SOURCE CODE OF THE ENGINE\r\n\r\nI want to compile the complete source code of the engine and not \r\njust the samples.  How do I do that?\r\n\r\n[/usr/share/librebecca/doc/linuxInstall.txt] for Linux.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE DIRECTORIES AND FILES\r\n\r\nCan you give me an overview of all the files and directories of \r\nRebeccaAIML?  Under Windows these files are located at \r\n[<wherever_you_installed>\\...] and under Linux these files are \r\nlocated at [/usr/share/Rebecca]\r\n\r\nIf you have the source or binary distribution you\r\nhave the following directories of:\r\n\r\n[aiml]      Varoius AIML data sets that are included \r\n            with the RebeccaAIML distribution and used \r\n\t\t\tby the samples.\r\n\r\n[conf]      Various configuration files that the samples\r\n            use when they load.\r\n\r\n[doc]       Where all the documentation is located. \r\n            Everything from the API documentation, user guide,\r\n            to how to install Rebecca from full source \r\n            code is here.\r\n\r\n[include]   All the include files for building against \r\n            RebeccaAIML with C++.  \r\n            \t\t\t\r\n[resources] Various resource files needed by every sample \r\n            is located here.  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n[src]       Source code of samples and the RebeccaAIML \r\n            engine if you downloaded the source code.\r\n\r\nIf you have the source code distribution you have \r\na few extra added directories of:\r\n\r\n[src/rebecca]           Source code of the engine\t\t\t  \r\n\r\n[include/rebecca/impl]  Header files only needed for building\r\n                        the engine.\t\t\t  \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\t\t\t   \r\nENJOY and don't hesitate to email with questions, problems, or\r\nsuggestions on how to improve this project!\r\n\t\t\t   \r\n\r\nGIT'd By: Drake Justice: hallowname@gmail.com (no flame please)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
